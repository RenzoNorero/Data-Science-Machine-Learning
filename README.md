# Data-Science-Machine-Learning
Some data science and machine learning algorithms developed on my own with datasets from different sources, mainly from courses on coursera and MIT. Datasets are on the 'datasets' folder, for enthusiasts who want to work on them by their own. Most of files are in english, but some are in spanish.
